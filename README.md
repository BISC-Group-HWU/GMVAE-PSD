This work introduces a novel **Gaussian mixture variational autoencoder (GMVAE)** for pulse shape discrimination (PSD) in organic scintillators. The GMVAE effectively separates neutron and gamma pulses **with minimal supervision**, showing strong performance even with limited labeled training data and variations in energy spectra between training and test sets.
